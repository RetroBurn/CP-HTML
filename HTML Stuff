HTLM Website

An HTML document always starts with <!DOCTYPE html>

An opening HTML tag starts like this: <html>
And a closing one has a slash in it:</html>

Bodies are essential in a website so that you can add image, buttons and texts.

Break tag are self breaking tags. Where there is only one tag. <br />

<p> is the child element and <body> is the parent element

This displays the title on your website. <h1>Hello World</h1>

Programmers use two tools to visualize the relationship between elements: whitespace and indentation.



REVIEW

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the 
structure and content of a webpage.

Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags 
between them.

Single-closing tags cannot enclose raw text or other elements.

Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax: <!-- comment -->.

HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child
of the enclosing parent element.

Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing
how elements appear in the browser.

Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships
visible.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML
files.

The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.

Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the 
page.

You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the 
head.

A webpage's title appears in a browser's tab.
Code for visible HTML content is placed inside of the <body> element.
